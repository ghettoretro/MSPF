Title: Rebuilding Cognition: A Modular Symbolic Processing Framework for Structured Interpretation in Entropy-Rich Environments

Abstract:

The Modular Symbolic Processing Framework (MSPF) introduces a new architectural approach to AI-integrated systems: one that prioritizes symbolic integrity, recursion, and structural enforcement over generative fluidity. In contrast to agentic chains and orchestration toolkits that privilege prompt novelty or autonomous chaining, MSPF scaffolds interpretation as a recursive, schema-bound, logic-validated process.

It accepts entropy (images, tags, narrative fragments) and outputs validated, symbolic insight through modular components: logic engine, LLM constraint harness, schema validator, and override-capable interfaces. Built for interpretability, not automation, MSPF enables meaningful insight under constraintâ€”turning contradiction into signal and prompting into process.

Problem

Current frameworks treat LLMs as cognitive engines

No structural validation, contradiction logic, or recursion depth

Hallucinations and drift are treated as tolerable noise

Symbolic data (tags, tone, structure) is flattened or ignored

Solution: MSPF

LLM as subordinate module, not decision maker

Schema-locked output with enforced structure and retry cycles

Embedded symbolic logic: contradiction detection, rule stacks, recursion depth

Versioned schema hub and modular override interfaces

Built for local-first execution, auditability, and testable cognitive scaffolds

Architecture

LLM Sentinel: Retry wrapper with schema validation and bounded prompt role

Validation Kernel: Central schema validator + correction logic

Symbolic Logic Core: Filtering, contradiction, rule logic, recursive structure

Schema Hub: Versioned schema library across systems

UI Scaffold: Optional CLI, Streamlit, or FastAPI override/test layer

Use Cases

SPIRAL: Recursive cognition and contradiction arbitration

AE_Systems: Metadata intake, validation, and structured output

E_Lude: Symbolic compilation of creative identity (track titles, tags)
